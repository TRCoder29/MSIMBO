<!-- Stylesheets:
	*There are three instances of CSS styling in the form of either an external or internal stylesheet, or an inline styling element present in the document.
	*Both internal and external create conflicts in areas like the header width, even if only one will be read. It's too cluttered and should be condensed.
	*Also, there is no telling what the styling is for file1.css and file2.css, so more information is needed if we are to choose one or the other. Potentially, both could be used, but it would be easier if there were just one.

		*Changed my site to My Site for appearance
		*Assuming that the header class included here is being referenced above, however the styling appears as 30px, while the width=300. I've decided to change:
			*width:30px; to width:300px;
